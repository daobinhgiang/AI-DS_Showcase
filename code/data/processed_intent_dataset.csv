I feel so alone, and I feel as if I can't rely on anyone for support. This is not because they're not trying, but because I'm just not meeting where they want to... or the other way around.

I honestly don't know if I'm making sense but I've been in one of my lowest points for a while, and I can't help but keep crying every few minutes. I just want someone to talk to without giving me advice or telling me it will be ok.

It's not ok. I don't know if it will ever be ok. I don't even see myself surviving this weekend. But having someone I could talk to and listen to me just plain out would be amazing.

Would like some advice from people with experience with depressed partners. Like so many other, my ex pushed me away and broke up with me. He has had issues with his mental health all his life, does meds but won’t go to therapy.

Now, I am to channel my insignificant energy towards earning my livelihood, fuck livelihood, even earning basic needs such as food would be an overstatement.

"**All trauma is trauma.**  


To the brain, anything that is traumatic, or causes hurt or pain, is trauma.  


There is no gauge to say how severe a trauma is.  


Don't invalidate your trauma just because you think that it is not as severe as someone else's trauma. It doesn't work like that.  


All trauma is valid. All trauma is trauma.  


There are so many different types of trauma.  


Emotional neglect with a parent working too much during your childhood.  
Physically abused by a parent.  


Both examples above are trauma to the brain.  


But .. regardless of the trauma, you are not broken. You deserve the same amount of love, joy and happiness as everyone else. And you can get it.  


Stop telling yourself that you are not whole, that you're not worthy and drserving. Tell yourself the opposite and maybe you start to finally believe it.  


Maybe you were emotionally abused or physically abused .. and you have been telling yourself every since that you don't deserve love and affection. And now? .. you believe it right? This is your story. Well, change the story. Identify the story that you've been telling yourself, find the lies in the story .. and make up a new one, a truthful one.

"as the title says. i’m 19 years old, i just finished college and got amazing final grades. i have a loving girlfriend of 3 years, loving parents, i’m in great shape, have good friends, in a good place financially. i’ve struggled with bad depression and some substance abuse and SH before a few years ago due to some past trauma which is still so negligible compared to what others on this sub talk about. i feel so entitled and ungrateful living such a comparatively good life yet having these feelings. i don’t know why my depression is coming back when i’m at such a good point in my life. i genuinely want to fucking kill myself, like really badly. it’s so much worse when you know there’s not really a reason to feel like this. sorry if this post doesn’t belong here as my situation is nowhere near as bad as other people’s. i’m not here to seek attention or a reaction, i just want someone to talk to because it feels like i can’t relate to anyone and it feels fucking lonely. i feel guilty asking for help but thanks for taking the time to read this and hopefully commenting :)",report_emotion,2
I went up to my co worker put my hand in his shoulder. I said hey brother he tells me haven’t you heard that people could be possessed by demons. He’s very religious but he used to talk to me all the time now he just ignores me like everyone else like I’m not even there. I just try to be friendly and he told me it’s not about being friendly he could be possessed by demons.

 I must scare away decent guys. I have rejected nice guys.I am so jealous of people in a good marriage or who have found their soulmate. I have decided to never date or be with another man because it will just be a nightmare.

"So basically when I don't cuddle for a long time I get depressed. And that's how I'm feeling rn.

I've been focusing too much on my work (freelancing/workin from home) in the last few MONTHS. And it's kinda hard to find someone I get along with. 

I wanna hold someone warm and tight across my arms before I sleep, kiss em on their forehead, Say to em I love you. And do the same in morning, before we get out of bed. Comforting someone would make me feel so comfortable too. This even motivates me to work more enthusiastically. 

Now this feels like a basic need for me. And ignoring it is making is affecting me so negatively.

Just a lil background info bout me; I'm not sure if that's necessary to mention, but I'm gay. However I absolutely wouldn't mind having platonic* cuddles with either a man or a woman. 

I'm 21 yo fit and good looking. *Hopefully you are fit and good looking too. Prefer older. 26 - 36. Not into younger than 26 honestly.

I remembered once a group of ladies were sitting with some of the staff and chatting about stuff, and another patient was crying hard and obviously having a problem. The staff just pretended to not see what was happening and kept chatting with the old ladies.

Any kind of therapy was aimed at the lowest common denominator, and that's understand but also useless. It was maybe playing word games or reading the safety rules. Nothing helpful.

"Tonight my [35m] stbxw [38f] and I had a little bit of a disagreement about the kind of dish soap I bought. She had a rough day at work and was taking it out on me. 

Before we decided to separate my night would have been spent taking special care of her. I would have walked on eggshells, rubbed her feet, done everything possible to make her happy. She still would have groused around but I would have moved heaven and earth to make her smile. I would have apologized for getting the soap that doesn't smell nice even though it was on sale. 

Never mind that she almost never did anything like that for me.  Never mind that's how she was most nights the past few years. Worn out, unhappy, unwilling to take care of herself. Tonight I was going to do my husbandly duty and make her happy. 

Then I remembered, she wants a divorce. She doesn't want me to make her happy again. That's not my responsibility anymore. I kept her company, put the kids to bed, but I didn't do anything special for her. 

It was such a relief knowing that I didn't have to spend another night trying in vain to make her feel better. I could take care of myself for once.

"Trust issues, and some other problems too.I'm 15 and I go to high school, I have plenty of friends and parents that kind on the surface care about me. I've never planned telling my parents about my depression(I was never diagnosed by a professional because then I'd need to tell my parents, but as far as I can tell, and from what we learnt in our  psychology class it seems like depression.) and suicidal ideation as in our community mental illnesses and mentally ill people are treated as jokes and they are never taken seriously, and mental illnesses are almost always used as insults. but so is homosexuality but I didn't have a problem talking about it to my friends and they were surprisingly accepting and they might as well be the reason I am the person I am today.

 But I just can't get the words out when I want to talk about my depression, they are as educated as I am about the topic and they'd probably be understanding and supportive, yet I feel like I can't trust them and/or even if I can that they would think of me differently and pity me. I know that they wont but I've always had trust issues growing up and learned not to trust people, and to always keep my feelings to myself. A couple of weeks ago while we were walking to a coffee shop I was talking with one of my friends about the lack of emotional and mental support and materials in our country(TRNC) and she seemed totally aware of the situation and even talked about ways we and adults could raise awareness on the topic.

But I think it all comes down to one sentence one of my friends said when I snuck in the possibility of one of us being depressed in our group, she said ""you can't be depressed, I know who you are and you just don't **seem** depressed, **you're always happy**"" which lead to a multi month long depression episode along with some other triggering factors.

I got over that, but I think it is one of the reasons I can't get out the words to tell them about the fact that I think about suicide every day.

either way if I tell them or not, I still don't know how to talk about it to my parents who are definitely more close minded, and less accepting(My mum offered to take me to the doctor when I came out to her 3 years ago, and asked what was wrong with me for **wanting** to ruin my life, and create bullying and insult material for people.)

I've been struggling with depression since middle school (diagnosed as clinical depression) and as if it weren't bad enough, two years ago I started having really bad anxiety (diagnosed as general anxiety disorder). I spent my first year of college at a community college and despite feeling continuously low and having zero friends, I passed my classes fine. I transferred to a university for my second year and things were a little rocky, but I did okay my first semester. My second semester, I dropped out of my classes halfway through because my depression and anxiety were too much. My third year, I tried both semesters to attend school and dropped out both times. 

My family thinks I'm trying again this year, but really I'm living in an apartment that my best friend pays for while she goes to school and works and I sit on my bum all day. Last February, I stayed in a hospital for a week, but it didn't help a bit. I've been on different meeds continuously since I was 17 and I'm at a point where the pills keep me just functioning enough to get up and eat, shower, and not sleep ALL day (just half the day). I'm being pressured by my best friend to work, and I understand that, but even going out to buy milk results in a panic attack. My family gives me an allowance every few weeks, enough to buy my anti-depressants and anti-anxiety pills and see my therapist every other week. 

So I'm at this point, where I have a good bit of school loans on my shoulders (luckily not as much as it could be, since I withdrew so early these last two semesters) and going back to school is clearly not an option. Working isn't an option! Going home isn't an option, because I'll be guilted and every waking moment will be spent answering questions as to why I'm not in school or working, because my family doesn't understand why I can't ""just keep going"". They think if I ""get out and do things"" I'll be okay. They think I'm depressed and anxious because I'm idle, not that I'm idle because I'm depressed and anxious.

I don't know where to go now. My therapist and I were seeing each other weekly, but I have stumped her. I've been seeing her since coming to uni (my community college was in my hometown, my uni is 5 hours from my home town) and she's great. I've had an easy time talking to her. But now we're at a stand-still where nothing is helping. I don't really feel happy anymore. I'm sad, anxious, and have been having really awful bouts of rage over the dumbest things. I want to hurt myself, but I put all my razors and such away and it would be too much effort to get to them. But I feel like there's not really anything left for me. I'm just draining people of their money. Everyone is tired of me and how I won't do anything, how I'm ""not making an effort"". Death looks like the only choice from where I'm standing.",suicide,4
"I have to end thisI'm so empty and alone.  I have nothing to get up for, nothing to live for, I tried to hang myself a few weeks ago and ended up just sitting on the floor with the noose round my neck for hours. l've kept going to work as I can't afford to go off, but I'm drowning, I really want to end it but I feel so tired. My gp put my meds up and I'm a 3 month waiting list for cbt. What's the point, I don't believe I can get better now and I don't believe anything can help me.

I have destroyed my family now they know I want to die, I' eve failed at everything I've ever done.  Every night I drink and smoke weed to block everything out.

It feels like I’m watching the most pathetic movie unfold and I want it to be over already. Almost 20 years old and no high school diploma, not to mention I have 0 motivation for anything. My room is a mess and I’m a mess if I don’t have work (have to make myself presentable for that). I’m not happy and it’s not getting easier.

"I miss my 4 month old son and without him there's no point in life at all.So a year ago I gave up everything for a woman i loved. Moved from the UK to Arkansas, she was pregnant at the time and wanted to be around her family.

On June 26th he was born, Rayne Andrew Brady Stephen. He had my name, looked so much like me yet had his mothers eyes and smile and he is perfect in every way.

For the first 6 weeks I was there and then one day I found out she had a registered sex offender around my child and lost my cool and fought said offender; for that outburst she left me and I haven't seen my son in around 2 months now as she won't let me.

She's destroyed my character, lost me my friends, has convinced everyone I'm a meth and heroin addict while still letting this sex offender around my child and the police don't care when I tell them this as her small town police are friends with the family and corrupt.

I can't afford the 5000 dollars needed for an attorney to fight for him, so she's already won unfortunately and without him in my life and with no friends or family here I don't see any point in living at all.

My life, my family, has already been taken from me. So I'm already dead as far as I'm concerned and with nobody left to care I'm gone and him at an age where it won't hurt him I just feel like this is the time for me to do this.

After all he'll be raised on her lies and thinking I abandoned him anyway.",suicide,4

"My brain kill me any time i literally awakeComplicated, but easy at same time. Well, i have good and bad moments at life like all of you, movies, songs, friends and etc. On same time, with music, friends (and etc) i have 1 bad story that remove good one or neutralize it. I give simple example. I like to play osu, or at least try to, and there is a lot of maps of course. One of them from anime ""**No Game No Life""**, and i have one of my old ""friend"" (hope can call she like that), that being depressive, with really angry parents, suicidal thoughts, and so on. What do you think? When i hear it - i instantly remind about her, her stories, her tears... I saw and talk to so many people in my small age, and about **70% of this contacts** \- **bad**. Doesn't matter is that a parent story, school, incest... I can't cry anymore at all, i can't throw it away, i can't do anything because my negative thoughts that i CANT suppress in my head. World not hard. World is supress YOU by negative, and our mind also want it (i mean you read this post, so you want it). Also, recently i ""find"" sense of life, that i never hear before from anyone around me. Our brain want dophamine and make it in cosmical doses. Any way - he need it. If he get happiness not enough - it start slowly remind you about it, so you start searching:

1. Easy way to stop it
2. Drugs-Alchocol-Ciggarets
3. Replace it with another feeling, like pain.

Beside this, there is 3 types of people:

1. They can supress it and live
2. They can't, start smoke or drink
3. (like me) Just think suicidal thoughts, maybe even do one of them

"I'm torn. But in need of advice.Extremely Long post. I was in therapy during my 3rd yr of college briefly but didn't take it seriously even though I knew I had been feeling ""off"" since 15. By off I mean, emptiness, mild maladaptive daydreaming, anxiety. Now I wish I had put in more positive energy. I took last semester off even though I had only 1.5 yrs to go. I felt I didn't have it in me for that final lunge. Sometimes, however, I wonder if I simply caved to my therapist and older sister. Moved back home to tackle personal issues but wound up working a minimum wage job.  Was in a not so serious relationship that ended last month, hurt mostly because it was with a long time friend. Tried to reconnect with other hs friends within the first months of coming home but found myself spending a lot of time alone, escaping through music and sleep. Developed and tried twice to rid myself of scabies. Instead of reaching out to my family, I slipped back into the habit of bottling up my emotions and issues. I let things continue this way for 4 months. My anxiety and depressing thoughts kept me secured to what I perceived as a comfortable world in my head. I was hoping to become more independent of my parents in a lot of ways but felt myself being pulled in different directions by money, time, and energy. I felt (feel) I have lost the will to go on. As if I had led myself on with false hope and intentions. I see what people believe is in store later in life for me but I don't feel the desire or want to have those things. 

I tried to OD last week for the first time ever, my first thoughts date back to Nov 2014. Was found within an hour or two and taken to the ER. Stayed there until late in the evening. Escorted upstairs to the inpatient center. Sat in the waiting room until 5am to be admitted. Discharged the next day. I had a follow up appointment scheduled two days after my discharged but did not go because I still wasn't sure what triggered my attempt. Is it possible I'm numbing myself to the full extent of my pain? Over college, work, the breakup, long standing family issues? How can I not possibly know this for a certainty! 

I am open to therapy (but not medication unless as a last resort, I don't trust myself) but have no insurance and would need to apply for medicaid, but in the meantime I worry I won't have the resolve to wait, to get better. My family can't baby me all the time; it puts stress on both of us and I have to return to work soon. I've started making plans again (college, drivers license, going back to work) but I also keep making plans for another attempt (combining methods). I'm pouring myself into both choices. A major part of me is delaying another attempt to plan one that will be successful. One that at the very very least will not be a financial burden to my family. I know they will be hurting later, and that I am hurting now by not being able to promise them that I WILL get better. I can't promise that. If I don't get professional help, I fear I'll start to hate life completely. By advice, I guess what I really wish for are kind words to keep me going until I make an appointment this week.",suicide,4

"Deranged FatherI've been tired of life for awhile. But recently I've wanted to die more than ever. I have never expressed these thoughts to anyone, I mostly just make jokes about it to people.

He even walked outside bare naked last week. This is embarrassing and I think he has some form of serious mental illness. I have told him that he's behaving like a terrorist, but he responded by saying ""I'll do it again."" I honestly want to kill myself just to make him feel guilty about his shit attitude. Many years ago I would go to the store with him because he can't go himself. He used to punish me by waiting for people to be all around us and let out a loud fart. I think he needs serious help but there's nothing I can do about it. My sister threatened suicide many times before and all he says is ""Do It!"" I'm wondering if anyone else has met someone this messed up before.",suicide,4
"Spiraling further, I just need a friendly voice.Hey guys,

I'm a long time redditor, and as such I've always been aware of sw and the wonderful things you do, but until today have never been compelled to anonymize and solicit your help.

I'm in my late 20's.  I'm a white male in the US.  

I was born into relative privilege, never truly wanting for much.  Ever since puberty, however, I have always had social challenges that started out with simple teasing and bullying, but soon blossomed into full-fledged social anxiety and panic disorder, diagnosed as a Junior in high school.  I had a high ranking college education fully paid for and I stepped into adulthood debt free and set up.  I was placed in a sales position with the very multi-generational family business that had afforded me such an advantageous upbringing.  Soon I was saving up loads (to me) of money.  I didn't want to do this forever, but it seemed like a good stepping-stone.

I even decided to buy a small house, no small achievement for someone of my age.  And I did so.  3 months before the housing collapse and the onset of the recession.

I had roommates originally, but they left.  Our small business has been slowly collapsing, and my income has dried up.  Thankfully it still supplies a meager cash flow but all of my other attempts to find a job have been for naught.  

As it stands now, I feel like I am in a coma.  I've got credit card debt and am late on my bills.  I haven't been able to focus at work for months now, and my bosses are growing impatient with my performance.  I have been abusing alcohol and marijuana to numb myself when I'm not trying to work, and when I am, my teeth are clenched from the adderall I have been prescribed for ADD.  It used to work beautifully, but now it fails to keep me on task and just makes me skip meals, smoke too many cigarettes, and drink too much caffeine.   I have trouble getting to sleep at night and have trouble getting out of bed in the morning.

I'm becoming a social hermit and have been seeking out the company of others less and less.  The mere sound of my phone ringing makes me panic.  My parents are becoming concerned that I never answer.

I'm drowning under a mortgage, I've become socially detached, and could even get fired by my relatives for being so damned depressed I just sit in my chair and stare all day.  I used to go out, have fun, go to the gym, catch up with friends...  Now I just feel such despair that I can't even feel that engine inside me anymore - the one that says ""get up, go... do this...""  I just feel empty...

I don't think I would ever take sudden action against myself...  but I feel like gradually I'm doing it anyway.

If there is a voice of support out there, I would love to hear from you.",suicide,4

"I ran out of ideas, I can't keep doing thisThe last year of my life has been one unfortunate series of events after another. The love of my life left me and I couldn't get out of bed for weeks, I made some progress ... Got a new career, finally moved on and repaired a lot of the damage she did to my life.

Then I met her, a girl so completely perfect for me and she was even into me. 

The last three months have been an absolute trainwreck, she decided that she needed a useless boy-toy boyfriend instead of one ""She could see herself marrying and being with forever"" because she didn't want to grow up.

They live together now, a matter of a few hundred yards from my house and she barely talks to me now. My friends don't want to help me, my family doesn't have the time to deal with me... And I can barely summon up the will to go into work any more.

A found myself a few nights ago sat at my desk with about 2 dozen pills and a bottle of vodka... And I told myself I either find a way to fix this soon or I'm just going to give up. The girl I'm madly in love with says she wants to be there for me, as a friend, and briefly she does a good job of picking me up.

"I want to kill myself but I don’t know if I canI hate being alive. It’s been so, so, SO long since I’ve enjoyed being alive. I’ve finally came to the conclusion that it’s not going to cheat better. That’s a load of horse shit, that whole “It will always get better” shit. I’m tired of being told that. For years, I tried to keep telling myself that and I can’t do it anymore. I’ve taken so many medications that I can’t even remember the names of half of them, I’ve seen so many therapists, psychiatrists, and been to so many groups and I’m still feeling this way. I know it’s not going to get better. 

I don’t enjoy anything anymore. I used to love art and music and shit like that but now I just don’t have to the motivation to do those kind of things anymore. I used to enjoy long, warm showers to help me relax but I can’t even do those anymore. I don’t even shower period. I don’t eat, but when I do it’s junk, I don’t brush my teeth, I don’t brush my hair, the fucking works. I’m a fucking slob. I never leave the house unless it’s me being forced to go to school. Oh god, I’m so miserable. I’m tired of being sorry for myself. 

Literally nobody will care if I die. Like, nobody. First of all, I don’t have any friends. Nada, nope, none. Second of all, my parents don’t like me. I’ve been a freeloader all of my life, not contributing to the household whatsoever (their words, not mine) and also I don’t ever talk to them because it usually ends up in argument. The problem is that I’m not brave enough to kill myself. I have every reason to, I just am not motivated enough (ha).  Everything sucks, yada yada ya, blah.

"Lifestyle obsession.Do you ever feel that way ? Healthy people suck, they just can't face the truth.

You know what i'm talking about, don't smoke, don't drink, exercise, eat healthy. To me it's another way to brainwash kids into making them think that the healthy lifestyle, a house, a car, a respectable job and healthy food is the key to happiness. These people can't face the truth. I really feel like the hypocrisy of the modern normal lifestyle has increased and everyone accepts it. People used to joke about anti smoking ads. Now there are like millions of unnecessary studies about the food you shouldn't eat, and tons of really little stupid things like that. It's so ridiculous to me and i'm really alienated by it. These people spend their life trying to look like a lifestyle commercial ad. They are boring and they suck. Lifestyle obsession. Great, i'm now 100 years old, and still healthy.

I can't find a job, and there seem to be no opportunities for me after I finish school either. I'm so stressed out that I've started cutting myself again. If I can't handle my stress now, then I know I'll never be able to handle the WORSE stress that will come as I get older.

"I constantly feel like killing myself, hate school with a passion, etcThis is an account I've made because my friends and I were comparing comment karma the other day, and I forgot that I'd posted on SW with my actual account, resulting in questions from friends when they found my comments on SW. 

Anyway, I'm really not that special, I'm like everyone on this sub. 

 I hate my life, I wake up, cry thinking about how ugly I am and how high my voice is (I have a phobia of being photographed because I'm soooo ugly) I go to school, fall sort of asleep, walk a mile and a bit in -22 degree weather to my moms work. Wait 1 and 1/2 hours till my mom is done and drives me home. 

I go home, play mortal kombat, rip people apart in gruesome ways, beat the shit out of people, consider how fucking awesome being a real martial artist would be. I do a bit of homework, play league of legends with friends, consider how much I (and about 50 percent of the games playerbase) suck at the game, think about what being a pro gamer or designer would be like(to bad I suck at programming, and actually playing games).  Do more homework and cry myself to sleep.  

Sometimes I think doing shit would be cool.  This weekend I went to a farmers market with friends (and visited the nearby outlet mall) I got accused of stealing, opened my pockets to some cash and my phone, the manager awkwardly shuffled away as my friends and I stared at him. 
I found it to be very funny.  I should have said something witty, though.
Then we went to wal mart, played basketball in the aisles, as the employees laughed and didn't give a damn.  It was the best like I actually did something very neat experience.  

But this is never the case.  I love movies, I hatched a perfect plan - get a camera - shoot videos - go to film school learn MMA, be happy or the closest emotion to happy that I can achieve.  So my mom got me a camera thinking maybe I'd stop the despair I live through. 

I loved it, noticed I can't use a DSLR properly, and now it sits on a bedside table because I can't bring myself to learn to use it, because I consider how much homework I have, but when I'm not doing homework I  destroy people on a computer screen, I don't learn how to use my camera.

This is how every idea goes for me. "" I should get a hobby or something""  ""No man, way too much homework."" ""Wow I have no homework, time to play video games"". 

Anyway, my question is, why live life, it seems like a torture method before you're liberated from hell by old age or cancer.

"I’m a waste of spaceNot going to lie, if I were aborted for being autistic I wouldn’t even be mad. Well I wouldn’t be anything because I’d be dead but you get he point.

I can’t function socially. I’m ugly. Yes I shower and have good hygiene but that doesn’t change my unsymmetrical face. I’ve never been able to have friends. Throughout school I’d get bullied and heated up. I grew y’all quickly so it stopped because your average 13 year old is probably like 5’5 meanwhile I was 5’11. 

Please save your “someone will come along” “it’ll happen when you least expect it!” Because it’s lies. I’ve expected it and haven’t expected it and nothing has changed. I’ve only known rejections. But why would a girl go out with an ugly autistic man when she could at the minimum get a average looking guy with a decent personality? I can’t make friends so it’s stupid of me to even think that I could have a girlfriend. 

I used to frequent incel type subreddits but they don’t provide a benefit. They only make you more angry and tell you that self help doesn’t work. It does but only to an extent. Plus I don’t hate women and I’m not a “nice guy”.

Please save your “It’s gets better” and “there’s someone for everyone” because it’s a fucking lie. I’m the freak that ends up 40 and a virgin. You might seen me in person and think I’m normal but over time you see that no girls want me and no one wants to hang out so it then clicks that I’m a virgin freak that’s destined to be alone. 

*You make all these assumptions and it’s wrong. I’m not fat or underweight. I work out. I eat well. I have good hygiene. I’ve tried socializing. I have hobbies. Im not a neckbeard. I’m not a hermit. I know most of you will just read the title and type your typical projecting responses so thanks for the “help”. *",suicide,4

"I feel a strong desire to kill myself when I scroll through social mediaReal quick, I’m not in immediate danger, this is more of me getting something off my chest that’s been bothering me for a long time and I don’t know why I feel like this. I’m a teen boy who doesn’t have a lot of friends but the few friends I do have are very near and dear to me. Due to conflicting and busy schedules, I hardly ever see them and they’re often out with their friends if I’m busy otherwise. I also follow people on social media I don’t really know all too well but they’re in some of my classes. They all seem to have far more interesting lives than I do and they always look so goddamn happy. Even if they post something when feeling down they get a flurry of positive responses and support. 

It makes me feel so fucking empty.

I’ve been struggling with depression for several years now but most people just avoid me if I’m feeling down.

Also, everyone is way better looking than I am?

Like, I know I’m “average” looking, maybe even above “average” on good days, but I always feel like I look like a toad in pictures and I hate having my picture taken by other people, even if it’s pictures taken by people close to me like by my family or my gf. 

I feel like my life is so boring and uninteresting and no one really cares about what I have to say or do. Other teens my age have so many more followers than I do and they just post pictures of themselves or their food or their vacations or a fucking sunset over a lake. So I try to copy some of their trends but I can’t get anywhere near the 200+ likes they get.

It just feels like a giant game that I’m not a part of; a joke whose punchline is me.

I just wish I didn’t feel envious of the lives around me on social media. I know I have a lot going for me; I’m doing very well in my school, I’m on the right track to college, I’m maintaining a pretty healthy relationship with my girlfriend, and I’ve been having a good deal of fun playing and learning guitar on my own. My parents love me (even if they give me hell) and I have a job. 

So why do I feel so envious?! Why can’t I just feel normal and able to fit in with the rest?

I look like them and talk like them and dress like them why aren’t I them??

I just feel so alone with all these lives being lived around me.

"I have no will to live and I feel like a burden on my family, should I end my life?backstory: I'm autistic and have severe depression. I've tried probably dozens of antidepressants and they don't work. I feel like this massive burden on my family. I frequently lash out and attack them verbally, and when I get agitated I cannot control it. I don't have the money to move out, and to be quite honest I don't think I can handle the responsibility of it anyway. I dropped out of high school, and I have failed the GED test 7 times. The only jobs I have been able to hold down were moving lawns and stocking shelves at a grocery store witch I absolutely hate. It's too loud and there are too many people to interact with on a daily basis. From the minute I walk in the door it's a constant state of sensory overload. I think suicide is a rational choice in this situation. I will be leaving a note with the following information:

-Why I think this was a rational choice.

-No, there wasn't anything you could have done to help me. You've helped me more then I can thank you for

-this was not your fault in any way.

-I will be in a better place now, even if it's just no longer existing.

-I love all of you.

I will hanging myself in the woods far away from home. I think it's important that they don't find my body in the house, and are not the ones to find it. First responders encounter this sort of thing all the time, it will be less traumatic for them.
I will be taking all the money out of my bank account and leaving it in an envelope next to the note. Plus my disability cheque should still keep coming for a few months after I'm gone. Maybe they can go on a cruise or something. In almost any other situation, I think it would be a selfish choice, but I legitimately think they will be better off.

"My Fiancé cheated on me with my sister. I grew up in a very abusive household. Every day was a nightmare. My sister went to live with our Aunt and Uncle out of state while I was stuck with my parents. But I held in there, until highschool came around, and I met a guy who treated me like no on ever has. When he found out about my household, he offered to let me live with him and his family. I finally got out of that fucked up house, and I had someone who was taking care of me and showing me genuine love, it was the best feeling in the world. I tried helping out whenever I could, and I tried to be the best girlfriend I could possibly be, to pay him back. Eventually my sister got in contact with me, and planned on visiting for a couple weeks. But as she stayed with us, my boyfriend and her got unusually close, and it felt like he spent more time with her than me. Today I found a series of texts that are 100% concrete evidence that, they not only slept together, but also that he was going to leave me for her and kick me out. She seemed to have convinced him into think I was lying about everything, including my household. I have nowhere to go, except back to that hell hole. I feel betrayed and alone.

"Out of hope.I've spent a good chunk of my last year changing who I am, bettering myself, doing everything I thought would help and here I still am, hopeless and unhappy.

First it needs to be stated, I have no intention in killing myself, I'm to afraid of the afterlife to make any sort of hasty decision to end my life, with that being said, if I was guaranteed there was no hell, or heaven, I would have ended my life over a year ago, I am no ashamed of this, some people are just meant to live and others aren't.

I went through my whole last year changing everything about myself, from my lifestyle to my attitude, I went from being a lazy fat slob who was an asshole to everyone, to a slim, muscular guy who is open to people and yet I'm still not happy.

What I've come to the conclusion of, the only thing left for me to do is sleep the rest of my life away, just give up and sleep when I can, I still plan on working out daily, and going to work, but as soon as I'm home, I'm just going to sleep, on the weekends, I'm going to sleep them away too, I honestly believe I am totally done with life and that I no longer wish to be here.

As I stated above though, I won't kill myself, I'm just to afraid to do that, however I am going to disappear and be alone from this point forward.

"I don’t want to be here anymore.I’ve never really been mentally well. My life has been filled with a lot of pain... I tried to fill that void with romantic love. Eventually I got into a serious relationship and he asked me to marry him. We did move really fast, with us living together just within the first 2 months and then getting engaged shortly after. After the engagement we argued constantly. A lot of it was due to me acting out of insecurity, fear, unhealthy mental status, etc. But he also played a part in it. When we had good moments they were the best. The bad moments were just outweighing the good significantly.

Fast forward to almost two years later. We have moved to a new state together.  He decided to break up with me about two months ago. It’s felt like my life has fallen apart. I’ve never lived on my own so we are trying to keep living together. We signed a new lease way before the breakup, so we move in to another place together next week. It’s been incredibly hard. He ended things because he through our relationship was toxic, he’s unsure about his sexuality, and he doesn’t want a high level of commitment with really anyone. I keep asking him if he’s seeing other people because I’m terrified of it. He has a trip down to his hometown next month and I expressed I’m scared that he would find someone else. He told me “so what if I do”. I can’t believe that someone who I thought loved me so much is doing this to me. I feel like I’m being punished.

Being around him feel like it’s killing me, I feel like a loser since I’m so behind in life (finishing college/adulting/being able to drive), my supper group is pretty small in this new state, I feel like I’m a disappointment to my family, etc.

I just don’t want to hurt anymore. What’s the point of sticking around when you feel so unloved and unwanted? I’m just a waste of space. No one ever wants to keep loving me because I’m so broken. It’s better if I stop living.",suicide,4
"Not sure where to go from hereI've been struggling to get this down for a while. Every time I start it, I get to the end, read it over, then delete it without posting. I'm just going to type it out this time and post it without rereading it, so sorry if something in here doesn't make sense.

I have been out of college for going on two years. Since then all of my friends have scattered across the country. I ended up around Philly about a year ago, after commuting from my parents house for almost a year. I work with people who, apart from 4 others, are all at least 15 years older than myself, so the 4 of us who are younger have a hard time finding things in common with the older ones, and they look down on us as if we're trying to steal their jobs. The 4 of us only really get along in a work manner as well.

Because of these things I know pretty much no one, and I very rarely get to talk to my old friends. I'm not that great at meeting new people. Sure, I meet people, but it never goes anywhere. I've never really been the person people randomly call to hang out in general. It also doesn't help that Philadelphians are pretty damn unfriendly. Another problem has to do with me being gay. I can not seem to meet gay guys who don't want to try to hook up. 95% of the time, if I do meet a gay guy he vanishes as soon as he figures out I'm not going to be hooking up with him. This is not limited to ones I've met on Grindr, Scruff or any of those other apps or websites. I am not a flamboyant gay and most people don't even know until I tell them, so meeting gays in real life is also very difficult.

On top of being cripplingly lonely, my job is kinda terrible. I was hired to be a designer, but all I end up doing is editing power points. Completely mindless work and puts my 4 years of college to fucking shame. It's easy to say ""Well go find a new job!"" but it's not that easy to do. I have produced really NOTHING to show an interviewer. I'm still stuck with my college work. What kind of interviewer would want to see college work after someone has been in the field for 2 years? Also, my place of work pays higher than really anyone else in the area, so moving to a new job could be difficult financially.

Now onto the dating side of my life! This stuff does intertwine with my friendships too. I have been single for over two years. My last relationship lasted 2 years and ended when I found out he was letting some other guy pay him to be allowed to suck his dick. This is not the first boyfriend who has cheated on me. I really don't think I've had a relationship end well. I've been on several dates over the past two years. The 3 guys I got along with the best had to move for various reasons very early on. One to CA for grad school, the other two to Pittsburgh for work. The other dates have been your general bad dates. People whose photos were 60lbs ago, shit personalities, etc.

From September to February, thats five months, I was under the impression that I was dating someone. Turns out, not so much. He wasn't under the same impression. That hurt a lot.

I also finally got to go on a date with a guy I've quietly had a crush on for a little while and he has liked me for a while as well. I met him because he works at a place I'd go for lunch when I work sometimes. It went really well - until the end. I said something sarcastically and he took it very wrong. Today I got a message from him: ""Please don't text or call me again, thanks"".

So, here I am after that, sad as usual. Normally, I'd just be upset for a little and move on. But it's getting harder and harder to do. Since college, and especially since moving here, I've been getting more and more bitter towards life, love, everything. I've been getting more and more depressed and secluded. I don't know how much longer I can take this. It's just one blow after another. It feels like I'm going insane.

EDIT: I'm also adding this. I AM out with being gay. People know, I don't bring it up unless there's a reason really, but I don't hide it. Where I work while a lot of people are fine with it, there are a few who make a lot of comments. I'm not sure if they don't know I'm gay or what. My Creative Director is one of the worse. He's very homophobic and makes a lot of comments about how it's wrong. Never in my direction, but he says it around the office. He also makes a lot of gay jokes and often talks with a lisp on purpose around some of the employees in a joking way (but I do find it offensive at times). He's not always around me, but when he is he tends to make my job very very stressful.",suicide,4

i've never felt like this before. i've never sat here and had these kinds of ideas, almost like i'm planning it out. and i'm unsure about it, or i'd be gone by now. but i keep reminding myself that there's just no one left. 

i just need to get it out somewhere. i don't know. i can't sleep soundly anymore so i might as well try and distract myself somehow",suicide,4
"Should I do it? Not much keeping me here.I enjoy music, video games and what not, but lately im just a lazy piece of shit. Should I do it? does anyone wanna chat?",suicide,4
"I want to leave for good.I am going to be totally open and honest here.

I want to shoot myself in the head and leave for good.
I am such an ugly human being, mostly on the inside but I'm fucking ugly on the outside too.

I lie everyday. Everything from small lies to big lies. I tell people things they want to hear, I don't care if they're true or not, I just want to adjust to people and having things in common with others makes me feel connected to them. I feel like I'm very odd and lying to them to make myself connect better, is something I do all the time. And it makes me feel sick, I am so disgusted with myself.
I feel like I cannot live with myself any longer. It's just too much.

Recently, my mother found my stash of cocaine and weed and she teared and got torn apart. My heart broke and I know that it's my fault.
She knew I used to smoke pot but never did she know I did coke. I admitted to her that I did pot and I promised that I had quit for about two years. All lies, I've been actively smoking weed for about three years, and I recently started doing coke (about five months now).

My father is the greediest man on the planet we know as Earth, and he's such an asshole. I hate him, he hates me and I can totally understand why. Because I'm just such a fucking idiot.

No girl wants me, and I see why, because I'm a fucking freak. I am so boring and alone all the time. People ask me out but I keep saying no. I make up false excuses and shit. They tell me: ""Come out and BBQ with us!"", and I reply: ""No, I don't like to BBQ."" but in reality, I LOVE to BBQ.

I've got a gun and I'm so ready to go. So, so ready.

I wrote a letter to my family and everyone else involved in my life.
This is what I wrote:

----------------------------------------------------------------------

First of all, I am sorry for not being flawless. I wish I had no flaws and that I was perfect, but wishes are nothing but small fragments of our imagination full of false hope and joy in the await for whatever we want to come true.


I would like to say that I entered this world innocent, and I would like to leave it innocent as well.

I am a coward for I cannot face my problems and flaws. Instead I run as far away as I can from them, and then I hide until they come looking for me and pull me out and tear me apart.

I am a liar for I tell false things all the time to people just so that I can adjust to them and have as much in common with them as possible to not feel like a misfit or a weirdo.

I am false for I hide my emotions and tell myself to smile when I really want to frown and to laugh when I really want to cry.

I am lost for I thought I knew where I wanted to go, but I lost my ways very long ago.


I do not consider myself a criminal, I do not consider myself bad and I definitely do not consider myself evil.

I have no intentions of hurting anyone or anything. I’ve never hurt anyone physically for I am not man enough. I’ve probably hurt people emotionally for I am human, but I certainly didn’t do it for the sake of pleasure or just because I felt like hurting someone.
If I’ve ever hurt you, in any way, I am very sorry.


I’d live to see the day when drugs are gone, alcohol disappears, cigarettes vanish, evil becomes good, darkness becomes light and everything becomes beautiful, happy and joyful.
I’d live to see the day when children can play peacefully, when war is no more, when people are living the life they want to live and when there’s justice and equality everywhere.
I’d live to see the day when everyone accepts death as something natural and beautiful, instead of something horrifying and evil.

This would be amazing, but that’s nothing but wishes; pieces of imagination puzzled together to give me a perfect view of how I’d like the world to become.

I promise you, for as long as the human race rules this planet none of this will become true.
I’ve lost my hope and faith in humanity.



Lastly, I would like to thank my beautiful mother for raising me so well. I love her to death.

I’d like to thank my stepfather for treating me fairly and being so truthful and nice. I love you.

I’d like to thank my very best friend Jakob for being there for me at all times. I love you.

I’d like to thank everyone else involved in my life for making my days worth to live. I love you all so much.

I’d like to thank my father for being such a greedy man and a total asshole, but it motivated me to continue on and prove him to be wrong at all times when he told me that I would never make it.

Well guess what? He’s right. I never made it, and I’ve lost. I dedicate this to him and in victory, I’d like to congratulate him for finally defeating his biggest enemy and getting rid of his largest problem: me.
I fucking hate you.


I’d like you, mom, to burn all my possessions and everything I’ve ever owned.
I want my body to be burned and I’d like the ashes to be thrown away someplace (I really don’t care where) as if I never existed.

Thank you. Please, don’t grief. This is my choice and I believe I’ve done the right thing.

There’s not more I’d like to say.

I hate life and I believe I was sent here for no reason.
I am nothing, I never was anything and I’ll never be anything but a memory. Please forget me.

I wish you all a happy life.

Please, mom, make this letter public. I want the whole world to see it, as my last wish.
Feel my pain, understand it and learn from it.
That’s my ultimate request.

Goodbye motherfuckers, see you on the other side.

---------------------------------------------------------------------------------

I really don't know what to do anymore... I am without hope.",suicide,4
"I'm am so fucking tired of living.

Every. Single. Goddamn day I wake up after my 3-5 hours of sleep ready to die! The only solace I get is using my dab pen constantly to forget about the cesspool of emotions that my brain contains. I don't think i've been sober since July 8th, but who the hell remembers! I certainly don't. I only go to half my classes, and I barely feel the motivation to do homework anymore. It's the same routine every day. Wake up. Go to school/work. Come home. Stay awake for endless hours because you think about how many times you've embarrassed yourself in front of people. How many times you've been a burden. How many people you've hurt. I've tried for so long to be happy. I took 90 prescribed sleeping pills 2 years ago to try and end it all.

Sadly, it didn't work. I can't even kill myself right.

I bullshitted my way out of therapy and psychiatry. All I said was ""Yea I'm ok :)"" and they believed it. Only reason I wanted out is because therapy doesn't work for me. Talking about my problems won't make them go away. There's nothing you can say to me that will make my father stop hating me. There's nothing you can say to take back all of the years of abuse. I can't get over it. If i'm not good enough for the man who fucking created me, a deadbeat alcoholic, then whats the point? I don't have enough willpower to kill myself. I'm afraid if I survive another attempt I'll never get out of therapy. 

Work is hell. School is hell. Home is depressing as fuck.

But I should be fine right? I have enough money from my job to pay off community college, I just got a boyfriend who cares about me, and I'm passing all my classes. So what should I even be worrying about?

Good things never last for me. Every boyfriend i've had shows their psycho side eventually. I'm really trying this time with him. I want to trust him. I want to let my guard down. I just can't. I've done that too many times and got my heart broken. I'm done.

I usually only eat one meal a day now. Antidepressants don't help with anything.

Anyways the only reason i'm posting this here is because my friends are tired of hearing about my problems.",suicide,4
"What is the point of trying?I'm sick and tired of living right now and am seriously thinking about suicide. I feel so alone. Honestly, the only people that would really care if I died, moved away last night. I've been cutting for a while now, and I seriously am tired of living in a world full of people who hate me. I really am. I can't think of anything to keep me from killing myself. I just want to die.",suicide,4
"On paper, my life looks pretty fucking fantasticI have a family that loves me and, after 31 years of putting up with my shit (that has only escalated as the years go on), still continues to love me. I, on the other hand, dodge family events like the plague, and if I do show up I make excuses to leave early, or I end up crying in the bathroom or getting into a fight with my parents over ridiculous shit. They recently made a donation to my state's charity for survivors of sexual violence and told me that they did so...using the factual information that I have (I am a victim of sexual violence and finally told them about a year and a half ago), combined with my stupid fucking brain twisting every goddamn thing that people ever try to do for me into some kind of plot against me, I immediately assumed they were guilt-tripping me for not being around a lot recently due to depression, and I lost it...and my fay was ruined (which I'm 99.9% positive was not their intention in making a donation).

I have a boyfriend who I started dating when I was 16 who also still continues to love me, despite my shit and all the shit I've put him through. We've broken up and gotten back together 5 or 6 times over the years...we got back together after almost 4 years apart in October, and I'm terrified that he is going to realize I am just TOO MUCH for him to handle and cut the cord (while a lot about me was the same 4 years ago, so much is so different now, and trauma + periods of heavy and hard substance use + decreased ability to regulate my emotions and impulses + prolonged malnutrition--I've had an eating disorder for 2 decades, and I've spent the better part of the past 4 years significantly underweight--is probably throwing him for a loop).

A job that actually is meaningful to me, through which I get to help others who struggle with mental health diagnoses. My job description does not explicitly say ""give others mental health care advice,"" but more often than not, I end up doing just that (I always preface any kind of advice/suggestions with ""This is coming from a non-clinician, but [blah blah blah]""). Anytime somebody thanks me for whatever, whether it's for simply listening to them, telling them about a mental health resource their own fucking doctor didn't tell them about (who knew there is a crisis text line? Apparently zero psychiatrists in my part of the midwest), or working reeeally hard to get them seen by a MHP at our clinic sooner than 3 months from now (because as we all know, 3 months is way too long to wait if you're hurting), I feel my heart grow a little bigger. But not long after that, I chastise myself, because who the fuck am I to be doling out mental health advice?? If any of these people I ""help"" were a fly on the wall in my apartment (the state of which is a metaphor for my life, as one of my parents told me one time after seeing it not even at its full potential of filth), they would see strewn about months of dirty laundry and dishes, empty beer and diet coke cans, prescription bottles (some of which I'm prescribed, some I'm just stockpiling), and just straight up garbage. Garbage and mess everywhere. I am disgusted with myself even more every time I come home to this shithole.

I could go on, but I realize this got way too long.

TL;DR I have so many reasons to live, but none of them are enough to make me want to continue living. This alone makes me feel like a selfish, entitled piece of shit, and just makes my desire to die even stronger. 
Please give me reasons to live that will actually change my mind about committing suicide.",suicide,4
"I’ve been writing a suicide note for a yearSo weird how this stupid note is the one thing that’s keeping me in the world right now.

I’ve been trying to get it right for so long that I’ve ended up writing about 20k words and it’s turning into a book where I’ve basically documented my entire nervous breakdown. Some stuff in there is really messed up, my deepest thoughts and basically every reason why id ever want to take my own life. I’ve thought about everything, and I still have so much that I want to add.

This is such a weird situation, but now that I’ve wrote like a quarter of a book I don’t feel like I can leave the world until it’s done and I have something that I’m actually proud of to leave behind. But it’s ruining everything else in my life right now because I have no motivation and I just keep telling myself that nothing matters because I’ll be dead anyway once my note is done. 

I’m just so torn about whether to finish this shit or just give up sooner rather than later. This is such a weird situation. I don’t even know why I’m putting this here either so don’t bother asking what the point is. I guess I just think it’s fucked up that I’ve took a suicide note and made it my lifeline for a year, but I can’t exactly tell that to anyone irl. So, here you go, Reddit.",suicide,4
Future.I cannot see into the future. I cannot see a life with me in it. When I think about the future and what it holds for me I just see hey black space. I really can't see what my future holds for me. it seems that no matter how much I think I've changed from the person I used to be I will never change enough and I will always be the person I hate so much. I just want someone to crash into me or for me to get hit by a stray bullet because when or if that happens I will not fight to stay here. I'll just let myself go.,suicide,4
"Remembering my mom singing “You are my Sunshine” moves me to tears and it’s the only thing that keeps me calm.She used to sing it to me all the time when I was little. It was my lullaby. I’m only 14 but I feel that all the good times are gone. My dad says we can make new memories together as a family but it just isn’t the same. I asked my mom to sing it to me and she did but it just didn’t sound like that soothing voice I remember.

I cried tonight. I’m crying now. I thought that I forgot how the cry. I can’t resist it. Looking through all my old toys, old memories, I’ll never have those times back. I remember going to the park with my dad in kindergarten, playing in the autumn. I try to recreate the memories but it isn’t the same.

This one lyric of that song breaks me:

“Please don’t take my sunshine away.”

I want to die so badly, but I’m her sunshine. I can’t leave but this life is so stressful. I don’t understand. I feel like I’m falling. That lyric is telling me to stay. She’s telling me to stay. But I just can’t handle it. I can’t. I’m scared i’m scared i’m scared I’m scared I’m scared.  The good times are gone and I want to go so badly but that song. That damn song. That damn lyric. I can’t. I just don’t know what to do.",suicide,4
"My life is going downhill every single day.I do know what to do anymore. I want to end my life. 

I've been stressed and depressed for the past year or two now, tried to hide it from everyone near me. The things that are happening to me are almost unbearable. 

I have almost burned my house down, my parent got into debt because of me. I dont feel like Im being loved anymore because the parent is now mad at me, it seems. The only person I love is my ex, and he is busy flirting with another girls and counting me as just a friend. I also have been crying a lot lately, I cut my wrists with a knife to tet rid of stress, and now I think that the only way to escape is to what I have to do.",suicide,4
"What is the point of living?I don't know, I just don't think there is any point in me continuing to live.

My friends I realise aren't really friends, I don't think they really give a shit about me anyway, I don't think if I wasn't there it would be any different to them.

My family, I love a lot, but I am just a burden to them. My mother supports me at university while I'm trying to study (let me get to this point) and she can hardly afford to live her own life, which kills me because she deserves to. My sister worries just about us too much, and it drives her mental, literally she has mental disorders from it. I can't bear to hurt them anymore for my uselessness. Not to speak of my father, who the piece of shit was a cunt at every stage, I don't even talk to him, it's been 2 years.

I try and try to get jobs but I can't, resume in person, online don't work for me, and this is the reason my mother supports me. I can't continue without getting one, and I fear even with the qualifications I have I can't.

University is a I don't even know. I got into architecture last year, and wanted to do that with my life, but I hated it. Decide to go after military, but was told because I quit uni I couldn't get in, and if it had of been before then I would have. Now started game design, but I lack any drive to do it, I am just lazy.

Physically I am fat and ugly, I try to make efforts to get fit and exercise and eat well but I can't lose weight and I just get sick of trying. I never excelled at sports and was only average at what I put my hand to. The only sport I ever really loved with a fiery passion was karate and it was taken away from me by a person who didn't like me and got me kicked out of the club. ruining what now seems in reflection my one chance I had to redeem my body and soul but I couldn't.

Relationships are fruitless because of the said physicality and even then I can't talk to girls irl, maybe a bit online but not properly.

Which leads me to my personality, I think I am a arsehole. I try to be nice, but no one appreciates my conversation, my debate or my jokes, I think maybe I am just a bad person.

Which leads me to the conclusion, why continue living, at least with my death i unburden my family, I allow my friends to be rid of trying to fake like me, and I don't have to keep making attempts at living life that I can't follow through on.

I don't know whether this is the place to discuss, but I don't even know, I'm afraid of death, and I don't even have the small good in me to end myself so others can be free of shit I put them through. ",suicide,4
I have a date set nowIt'll likely be Tuesday unless my therapy appointment on Monday goes well. Otherwise there's literally no way out of this.,suicide,4
"I want to be a little kid againIt feels like the only thing that will make me happy is being a kid again, where the only thing that worried me was if I’d be able to have dessert or not. It just hurts so fucking bad, it feels like I’m dying, like my chest is imploding. I’ve never wanted anything more in my life. But I know I can’t have that, so it seems like death is my only option ",suicide,4
"Stuck please helpI go to a pretty good college in NYC. Everyone in my HS was shocked when I got in and I was so proud of myself because it felt like the years of suffering in my hometown were finally over and something good was coming and I was gonna prove everyone who shit on me wrong. That was the only hope I had to keep me going through school the hope that I'd be successful and the torture and teasing wouldn't matter in the future. Now I'm a junior who's behind on credits because my depression got so bad I could never go to class and failed. I don't have a solid friend group. I genuinely feel like the people I hang out with don't want me around. I gained like 70 lbs since HS because I try to binge eat my suicidal thoughts away. I suck in almost all my classes (the one thing I was good at was language and then the course got super hard out of nowhere because it's geared towards people who already speak it at home). I just don't see the point of being here anymore, but no school would take me with my grades if I tried to transfer. Plus it makes no sense to go to a worse school. I can't just drop out since I can't even get a job with my current resume that says I'm in a good school. So that means I'd get nowhere as a drop out and be unemployed. I came here with hopes to finally feel good about myself and become something but I fucked everything up in 3 years and it's past the point of fixing it. It's like the universe is telling me to end it now, but I don't want to hurt my family and best friend back home.  I'm stuck between ending it and continuing down a path of nothingness for the sake of people I care about. But what about how I feel? I don't want to hurt them but I can't keep going for everyone else but myself.",suicide,4
"I don't how much longer I can take thisEvery waking moment I'm anxious, I can't fully relax. This is going to he the rest of my life and I can't deal with that. I'm so alone which makes the anxiety much worse, always having to deal with it alone. I have just over a week of winter break left before I go back to school. I need to do it before I go back. I won't be able to handle school.",suicide,4
"I need advice pleaseSo I'm currently a full-time University student and failing my classes. My parents don't know and I can't tell them but they desperately want me to take summer classes as well. Thing is, I'm so depressed and suicidal that I cannot fathom this being a good idea. How the hell do I tell them I'm so suicidal that I can't even remotely imagine taking summer classes?",suicide,4
